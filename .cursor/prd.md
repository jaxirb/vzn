## üñ• Core Functional Requirements

### 1. Main Timer Screen
- Clean, minimalist layout.
- Display:
  - **Focus Timer** (preset 25m, 50m, 90m, or custom picker)
  - **Start Session** button
  - **Key Stats Always Visible**:
    - Current Streak (days)
    - XP (total earned)
    - Level

---

### 2. Session Timer Behavior
- Timer counts down from selected duration.
- **No Pause** option.
- **If canceled** or user exits the app:
  - XP is awarded **proportionally** based on completed minutes.
- **If completed**:
  - Full XP based on session duration.

---

### 3. XP System
- **1 XP per 2.5 minutes** of focused time.
  - 25m session = 10 XP
  - 50m session = 20 XP
  - 90m session = 36 XP
  - Custom sessions = (Minutes √∑ 2.5) XP

---

### 4. Leveling System
- **Escalating XP thresholds**:
  - Early levels require small XP amounts.
  - XP requirement increases progressively by ~10‚Äì20% per level.
  - Example model:
    - Level 1 ‚Üí 50 XP
    - Level 2 ‚Üí 120 XP total
    - Level 3 ‚Üí 210 XP total
- Level up **triggers celebratory animation/message**.

---

### 5. Streak System
- Completing at least **one 25-minute (or longer)** session per day maintains the streak.
- Shorter sessions **do not** count toward streaks.
- Missing a day = **streak resets to 0**.

---

### 6. Session Summary Screen
After session ends (completed or canceled):
- Show:
  - XP earned
  - Current streak
  - Level (with "Level Up!" animation if applicable)
- "Return Home" button to go back to Main Timer screen.

---

### 7. Authentication
- Simple login/signup:
  - Email + password (or optional auth provider if needed).
- Data stored securely:
  - Sessions, XP, Streaks, Levels tied to user account.

---

### 8. Settings Page
- Extremely minimal:
  - **Toggle sounds** (on/off)
  - **Toggle vibrations** (on/off)
  - **Log Out** button
  - **View Privacy Policy and Terms of Service** links

---

## üñåÔ∏è UX Notes

- **Default session duration** = 25 minutes unless user selects otherwise.
- **Session Picker**:
  - Quick options (25m, 50m, 90m)
  - Custom time picker (free-form selection)
- **Colors and visual language**:
  - Calm, neutral tones (e.g., white, soft gray, accent colors like blue or green).
  - Celebratory highlights (gold/sparkle) when leveling up.
- **Fast feedback loops**:
  - XP, streak, level updated **immediately** after a session.
- **Minimal button count**:
  - Focus on just one major call-to-action: "Start Session."

---

## üîß Technical Considerations

- **Data Persistence:**
  - Sessions, XP, Streaks, Levels saved to backend.
  - Handle edge cases (e.g., user force closes app mid-session).
- **Timer reliability:**
  - Timer should continue if app goes to background (best effort).
- **Performance:**
  - App must feel lightweight, fast, and reliable on common mobile devices.
- **Security:**
  - Basic account protection (e.g., password hashing if using email/password login).
